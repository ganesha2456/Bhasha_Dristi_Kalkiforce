📱 Bhasha Dristi – KalkiForce
🔤 Breaking Script Barriers Across Bharat

Bhasha Dristi is a smart mobile application that enables users to read, transliterate, and understand text written in different Indian scripts.
It helps travelers, students, and citizens easily read signboards, notices, books, and handwritten text across languages without knowing the script.

For example:

A person from Andhra Pradesh can read Punjabi signboards.

A visitor in Kerala can read Malayalam boards even if they only know Hindi or English.

Students can instantly convert regional scripts into Roman or their native script.

This is transliteration (script conversion), not translation, ensuring original phonetic(sound/pronounciation) is preserved.

🎯 Problem Statement

India has hundreds of languages which have 12 different scripts.
People often face difficulty reading unfamiliar scripts when traveling, studying, or accessing public information.

❌ Language barriers cause:

Confusion in public places

Dependency on others

Accessibility issues

Information gaps

✅ Bhasha Dristi solves this by providing real-time script conversion using ML models.
